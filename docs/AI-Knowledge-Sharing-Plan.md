# AI Knowledge Sharing Strategy

## Overview
Sharing my learning journey from basic prompts to full integrated coding with AI, covering design, planning, review, coding, testing, and enhancements.

## Build in Public vs. Polished Launch

### Building in Public (Recommended for Learning Series)
- Share your journey as you build - design decisions, challenges, learnings
- More authentic and relatable
- Generates engagement throughout the process
- Shows problem-solving skills, not just final results
- Creates a narrative arc people can follow

### Polished Launch
- Wait until app is complete before posting
- More impressive final showcase
- Less risk of unfinished projects
- But misses the storytelling opportunity

## Suggested Content Series Structure

### Week 1-2: Foundation Posts
**Post 1: "From Basic Prompts to Production: My AI-Assisted Development Journey"**
- Share the evolution of how you work with Claude
- Before/after comparisons of your workflow

### Week 3-4: Real Project - Building in Public
**Post 2: "Building [App Name]: Design & Planning with AI"**
- Share your design decisions
- How AI helped with architecture

**Post 3: "Tackling [Specific Challenge] - AI as a Pair Programmer"**
- Real problem you solved
- Show the iteration process

### Week 5-6: Knowledge Sharing
**Post 4: "What I Learned: AI-Assisted Development Best Practices"**
- Patterns that worked
- Pitfalls to avoid

## Alternative Project Ideas (Progressive Complexity)

### 1. CLI Tool (Simplest)
- Jira integration CLI
- Faster to build and showcase
- Demonstrates API integration, testing

### 2. Web-Based Note App (Medium)
- Easier deployment (free hosting)
- Wider audience can try it
- Progressive: start simple, add features

### 3. Android App (Most Complex)
- Longer timeline
- Harder for others to test
- Consider after proving the concept

## Recommended Approaches

### Option A: Incremental Approach
1. Start with a simpler project (web-based note app)
2. Document the journey (3-4 posts over 2-3 weeks)
3. Launch and share results
4. Move to next project with lessons learned

### Option B: Hybrid Approach
1. Build the Android app BUT post progress updates
2. Share interesting problems/solutions weekly
3. Final post: "Complete journey" with demo

## Content Tips

- **Focus on Learning**: What surprised you, what was harder than expected
- **Show Code**: Share interesting snippets (not proprietary bank stuff)
- **Be Honest**: Include failures and pivots
- **Provide Value**: Each post should teach something
- **Keep it Technical**: Your audience appreciates depth

## First Post Suggestion

**Title: "How AI Changed My Development Workflow: A 6-Week Experiment"**

Content Ideas:
- Outline your plan
- Commit to building something publicly
- Ask for input on features
- Sets expectations for series

## Project Idea: Note-Taking App

### Core Features
- Simple notepad functionality
- Integrated Jira task creation
- Share notes with friends
- Tag system for organization
- Basic formatting options

### Platform Options
- **Web-based** (Recommended to start)
  - Easier deployment and sharing
  - Broader accessibility
  - Faster iteration

- **Android** (Future enhancement)
  - Mobile-first experience
  - Can be built after web version proves concept

## Next Steps

1. Choose approach (Option A or Option B)
2. Select starting project (Web vs CLI vs Android)
3. Draft first LinkedIn post
4. Break down project into shareable milestones
5. Set posting schedule
